/**
 * Vision capability guard.
 *
 * A model tagged `vision` in the catalog is advertised as accepting images, but
 * image requests don't go down the normal chat pipeline — `/v1/chat/completions`
 * hands them to the vision layer, which resolves the model against its own
 * registry and throws `Unknown vision model` for anything it doesn't know.
 *
 * So a `vision` tag with no vision-layer entry is a promise the gateway breaks
 * at request time. Maximo Atlas was exactly that until the OpenAI-compatible
 * vision path landed. This test connects the two lists so the next one fails CI
 * instead of failing a customer.
