/**
 * Settling token usage for a streamed response.
 *
 * Streaming has no single response object to read usage off, so the gateway
 * historically counted tokens from the request and response text once the
 * stream drained. That estimate ignores tools, system framing, and — since it
 * works from text — cached prompt tokens, which are the cheapest tokens a
 * provider sells. Adapters that can report real usage now do so on the final
 * StreamChunk; this prefers that and keeps the estimator as the fallback for
 * adapters and providers that report nothing.
