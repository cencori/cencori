/**
 * Public provider identity.
 *
 * Cencori's free tier runs on Cencori's own upstream accounts — Groq's Compound
 * systems and OpenRouter's `:free` listings — not on a key the customer brought.
 * From the customer's side Cencori genuinely is the provider: it owns the
 * account, eats the cost, and picks the upstream. Reporting `openrouter` there
 * exposes an implementation detail the customer has no relationship with and
 * cannot act on.
 *
 * Paid models are deliberately NOT relabelled. A customer calling `gpt-5` knows
 * they are calling OpenAI and may have compliance reasons to care; renaming that
 * would be misdirection rather than white-labelling. The model id is also left
 * alone throughout — only the provider label changes.
 *
 * This is presentation only. Internal records — `ai_requests.provider`, gateway
 * logs, cost attribution, circuit-breaker state — keep the real upstream name,
 * because debugging an outage and attributing spend both need to know which
 * account actually served the request.
