/**
 * Memory eval harness — Phase 3, Layer 0.
 *
 * The scoreboard that gates every later memory change. It measures ANSWER
 * QUALITY and memory hygiene, not cosine similarity: does the store recall the
 * right facts, drop superseded ones, resist irrelevant recall, and never leak
 * what should have been redacted?
 *
 * Methodology follows the public multi-session memory benchmarks (LoCoMo /
 * LongMemEval): build memory from a transcript, then probe it with questions
 * whose gold answers are known.
