## The Problem

Building autonomous agents requires infrastructure:
*   Event Buses (Kafka/Redis)
*   Background Workers (Celery/Bull)
*   State Management (Postgres/Redis)
*   Retries & Dead Letter Queues

This is "Plumbing" that distracts you from your product.

## The Solution

Cencori acts as the **Serverless Operating System** for your agents. 

You define **Triggers** (Events) and **Actions** (Logic). We handle the rest.

### Key Capabilities

1.  **Async Processing**: Don't block the user's chat while your agent "thinks" or calls external tools.
2.  **Long-Running Jobs**: Workflows can run for minutes or hours (e.g. "Research this topic deeply").
3.  **Human-in-the-Loop**: Pause a workflow and wait for approval via API or Dashboard.
