A Workflow is composed of three main building blocks.

## 1. Triggers

A Trigger is what starts a workflow execution.

*   `chat.message`: Fires whenever a user sends a message.
*   `user.created`: Fires on new user signup.
*   `schedule.cron`: Fires on a schedule (e.g. "Every Day at 9am").
*   `webhook`: Fires when an external service hits your Cencori Webhook URL.

## 2. Steps

Steps are the individual units of work.

*   **LLM Step**: Call a model to generate text or structured data.
*   **Tool Step**: Execute code or call an API.
*   **Wait Step**: Pause execution for a duration or until an event.

## 3. State

State is the memory of the workflow execution. It persists across steps.

```typescript
// State example
{
  "user_id": "user_123",
  "plan": ["research", "draft", "email"],
  "current_step": 1,
  "draft_content": "..."
}
```

If a step fails, Cencori retries it with the **same state**. This ensures reliability.
