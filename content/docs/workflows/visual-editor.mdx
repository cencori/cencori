Cencori Workflows are **Code-First**, but we are building a **Visual-First** interface to complement the SDK.

> **Status**: In Development (Available Q3 2026)

## Bidirectional Sync

Most low-code tools force you to choose: *Clicking* or *Coding*.
Cencori's Visual Editor is different. It is **Bidirectionally Synced** with your codebase.

1.  **Code to Canvas**: We parse your `cencori.workflows.define()` code and visualize the graph.
2.  **Canvas to Code**: Dragging a new "Step" on the canvas generates the TypeScript code in your repo.

## The "Bridge" Workflow

This enables a powerful new workflow for teams:

1.  **PM/BizOps (No-Code)**: Build a "Draft" workflow in the Visual Dashboard. Drag steps, write prompts, define logic.
2.  **Export**: Cencori generates a clean TypeScript file (e.g., `workflows/onboarding.ts`).
3.  **Engineer (Pro-Code)**: Reviews the code, adds complex integrations or type checks, and commits to Git.

**No-Code for Prototyping, Pro-Code for Production.**

## The Canvas Experience

### 1. Visualization
Debug complex flows by seeing the execution path visually.
*   **Green Path**: Success.
*   **Red Path**: Error/Retries.
*   **Yellow Path**: Waiting for Human.

### 2. Live Debugging
Click on any step in the visual graph to see:
*   Input/Output JSON.
*   Console Logs.
*   LLM Prompts & Completions.
*   Retry History.

### 3. Rapid Prototyping
Drag and drop triggers and actions to sketch a workflow, then export the code to your IDE to refine the logic.

## Why Code-First Matters?

Visual tools hit a ceiling. Code does not.
By keeping the "Source of Truth" as TypeScript code, you get:
*   **Version Control**: Git history for your workflows.
*   **Code Review**: PRs for logic changes.
*   **Type Safety**: TypeScript validation for step inputs.
