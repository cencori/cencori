Cencori is the infrastructure layer for AI applications. We provide security, multi-provider routing, and comprehensive observability - so you can focus on building your product.

## What is Cencori?

Cencori sits between your application and AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.), adding:

- **Security** - Real-time protection against prompt injection, PII leakage, and jailbreaks
- **Multi-Provider Routing** - One API for all providers with automatic failover
- **Observability** - Full logging, analytics, and cost tracking for every AI request

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { Cencori } from 'cencori';

const cencori = new Cencori({ apiKey: 'csk_...' });

const response = await cencori.ai.chat({
  model: 'gpt-4o',
  messages: [
    { role: 'user', content: 'Hello!' }
  ]
});

console.log(response.content);
```
