Cencori is a **Cloud Intelligence Provider (CIP)** — the unified infrastructure layer for the AI-first world. We bridge the gap between building a "demo" and shipping a production-ready application that is secure, observable, and multi-cloud by default.

## The Production Gap

Most AI applications break when they hit production. They fail because of:
- **Security**: Prompt injections, PII leakage, and jailbreaks are trivial without a proxy layer.
- **Reliability**: Relying on a single provider (like OpenAI) creates a single point of failure.
- **Visibility**: Tracking costs and latency across multiple models is complex.

Cencori solves this by sitting between your application and AI providers, providing a unified API with built-in security and routing.

## Before you begin

To get the most out of Cencori, we recommend having the following ready:
- A [Cencori account](https://cencori.com/signup) to access your project dashboard.
- An API key for at least one AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google).
- A basic understanding of [AI Gateway concepts](/docs/ai/gateway).

---

## Core Primitives

Cencori is built on 5 fundamental primitives that handle the heavy lifting of AI infrastructure:

1. **AI Gateway**: A single, secure endpoint for all your model routing.
2. **Compute**: Secure, ephemeral execution for AI agents and logic.
3. **Workflow**: Visual orchestration for multi-step AI pipelines.
4. **Data Storage**: AI-native storage for context, vector sync, and integrity.
5. **Integration**: Pre-built connectors to external tools and databases.

## SDKs & Integrations

Cencori is designed to work where your code already lives. We provide three primary integration paths:

- **Official SDKs**: Dedicated, feature-rich libraries for **TypeScript**, **Python**, and **Go**.
- **Framework Adapters**: Deep integrations for **Vercel AI SDK**, **TanStack AI**, and **LangChain**.
- **Universal Proxy**: Use your existing OpenAI or Anthropic SDKs by simply changing the `base_url`. We are 100% compatible with the native ecosystem.

## Quick Example

Making your first request with the Cencori SDK is simple. We normalize the response format across all 14+ supported providers.

```typescript
import { Cencori } from 'cencori';

// Initialize with your Cencori Project Key
const cencori = new Cencori({ apiKey: 'csk_live_...' });

const response = await cencori.ai.chat({
  model: 'gpt-4o', // Or 'claude-3-5-sonnet', 'gemini-1.5-pro', etc.
  messages: [
    { role: 'user', content: 'What is a Cloud Intelligence Provider?' }
  ]
});

console.log(response.content);
```
