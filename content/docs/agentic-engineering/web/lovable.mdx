**Lovable** ([lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev)) is incredible at building full-stack web apps from natural language. By adding Cencori, you give those apps **Memory** and **Security**.

## Integration Strategy

Lovable often uses Supabase for the database. Cencori fits perfectly alongside it as the AI Logic Layer.

### Step 1: Add Context
In your Lovable project chat, instruct the AI:

> "I want to add advanced AI features. Please use the Cencori SDK (@cencori/sdk) for memory and chat completion. Refer to the documentation at https://cencori.com/llm.txt"

### Step 2: Implement Features

**Memory:**
> "When a user sends a message, store it in Cencori Memory using `cencori.memory.add()`. Before answering, retrieve context with `cencori.memory.retrieve()`."

**Security:**
> "Ensure that all user inputs are passed through Cencori's PII detection. If PII is found, redact it before sending to the model."

## Benefits
-   **No Vector DB Setup**: Lovable doesn't need to configure pgvector; Cencori handles it.
-   **Observability**: You can see every AI request your Lovable app makes in the Cencori Dashboard.
