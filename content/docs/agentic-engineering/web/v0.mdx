Vercel's **v0** ([v0.dev](https://v0.dev)) generates beautiful React/Tailwind UI. Cencori provides the brains behind the beauty.

## The "Headless" Pattern

v0 excels at the **Frontend**. Use Cencori for the **Headless AI Backend**.

1.  **Generate UI with v0**:
    > "Create a chat interface with a sidebar for history and a settings modal for selecting the AI model."

2.  **Connect to Cencori**:
    In your codebase (Next.js/React), creating the API route is complex for a UI generator.
    
    Instead, just tell v0:
    > "The backend API is located at `/api/chat`. It uses the Cencori SDK. Please wire up the `useChat` hook to send messages to this endpoint."

## Handling Streaming
v0 apps often use `ai/react` (Vercel AI SDK). Cencori is fully compatible!

> "My backend uses `cencori.chat.completions.create({ stream: true })`. Please ensure the frontend handles the streaming response correctly."
