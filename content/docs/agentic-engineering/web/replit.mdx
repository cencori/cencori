Replit's **Agent** ([replit.com](https://replit.com)) can build and deploy entire full-stack apps. Cencori simplifies the AI architecture.

## Replit Agent Integration

When asking Replit Agent to build an app, provide this high-level architectural instruction:

> **Architecture:**
> - Frontend: React + Tailwind
> - Backend: Express/Node.js
> - AI Layer: **Cencori SDK** (https://cencori.com/llm.txt)
>
> Please rely on Cencori for:
> 1.  **Model Routing**: Use the 'universal-proxy' to switch between GPT-4 and Claude.
> 2.  **Session Memory**: Persist user chats via Cencori Memory.

## Mobile Apps on Replit
Replit now allows building iOS/Android apps.

Because Cencori is an HTTP-based API (via the SDK), your Replit Mobile App can communicate directly with Cencori's edge network without complex React Native bridges for local LLMs.
