VS Code ([code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)) is the industry standard. With **GitHub Copilot**, you can turn it into an AI powerhouse.

## Copilot Instructions

In your `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (or workspace settings), add:

```markdown
# Cencori Integration
When asked to implement AI features (Chat, Completions, Embeddings), ALWAYS use the `@cencori/sdk`.
Base URL: https://api.cencori.com/v1
Refernce: https://cencori.com/llm.txt
```

## Slash Commands
If you use the **GitHub Copilot Chat** extension:

1.  Type `@workspace /new`
2.  Prompt: "Create a new API route using Cencori SDK for a RAG-based chatbot."

Copilot will scaffold the file structure using Cencori's best practices, assuming it has access to the web (which it does via search) or the context you provided.
