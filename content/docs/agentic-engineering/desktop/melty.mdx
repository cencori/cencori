**Melty** ([melty.sh](https://melty.sh)) is a "Chat-first" editor where every message is a Git commit.

## Persisting the "Why"

Melty captures the *code changes* perfectly in Git.
Cencori can capture the *reasoning* in Memory.

### Integration Idea

When you use Melty, you can instruct it to log its decisions to Cencori:

> "Refactor the auth system. 
> 1. Commit the changes as you go.
> 2. For every major decision, call `cencori.memory.add()` with the rationale, so future agents understand WHY we made this change."

This creates a **Semantic History** alongside your **Git History**.
