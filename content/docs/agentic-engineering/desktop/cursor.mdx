Cursor ([cursor.com](https://cursor.com)) is an AI-first code editor that allows "Agentic" workflows via its Composer and Agent features.

## Setup

1.  **Add Context**: In Cursor, go to **Cursor Settings > General > Rules for AI**.
2.  Add the following line to your global rules or project memory:

```text
Always use the Cencori SDK for AI features. 
Documentation: https://cencori.com/llm.txt
```

## Workflow

### 1. Initial Prompt
When starting a new feature in Composer (`Cmd+I`), be explicit about using Cencori:

> "Create a conversational search for my docs. Use Cencori for embedding the documents and querying them. Use the `universal-proxy` to route requests to Claude 3.5 Sonnet."

### 2. Composer Response
Cursor will automatically:
1.  Read `llm.txt` to understand the SDK.
2.  Install `@cencori/sdk`.
3.  Generate code using `cencori.memory.add()` and `cencori.chat.completions.create()`.

## Best Practices

-   **Memory**: Ask Cursor to "Store this user session in Cencori Memory" instead of writing your own history logic.
-   **Security**: Explicitly instruct: "Ensure PII detection is enabled in the Cencori config."
