Google's **Antigravity** is an agent-first development platform where you delegate tasks to autonomous agents.

## Integration

Antigravity agents are optimized for **reading documentation**.

1.  **Project Context**: In your Antigravity project settings (or `knowledge` folder), add a link to: `https://cencori.com/llm.txt`.
2.  **Task Delegation**: When creating a Task, reference Cencori.

## Example Task

**Task**: "Implement a secure AI support bot."

**Instruction**:
> "Use the Cencori SDK to implement the chat logic. 
> 1. Use `cencori.memory` to store conversation history and retrieve relevant documentation.
> 2. Use `cencori.security` to scrub PII from user inputs before sending to the LLM.
> 3. Deploy a Next.js API route."

## Why Antigravity ❤️ Cencori
Antigravity agents are powerful but can get "lost" in complex infrastructure code. By offloading the "hard stuff" (Security, Observability, Vector Storage) to Cencori's SDK, the Antigravity agent can focus on writing perfect business logic and UI.
