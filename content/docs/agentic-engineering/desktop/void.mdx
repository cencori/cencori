**Void** ([voideditor.com](https://voideditor.com)) is a privacy-first fork of VS Code. It gives you full control over your data.

## Ultimate Privacy Stack

Combine **Void** (Client Control) with **Cencori** (Data Protection).

1.  **Void**: Ensures no telemetry is sent to Microsoft/Code editors. Allows you to see the *exact* prompt being sent.
2.  **Cencori**: Sanitizes the data *before* it hits the LLM provider.

### Workflow

1.  **Configure Void**: Set Cencori as your custom OpenAI provider.
2.  **Enable Redaction**: In Cencori Dashboard, set PII Mode to `redact` or `mask`.
3.  **Code**: When you ask Void to "Refactor this file containing user emails", Cencori will strip the emails before OpenAI ever sees them.

This allows you to use powerful Cloud Models (GPT-4) on sensitive codebases without leaking data.
