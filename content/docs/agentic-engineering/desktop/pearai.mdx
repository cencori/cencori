**PearAI** ([trypear.ai](https://trypear.ai)) is an Open Source fork of VS Code that focuses on "Model Routing"—automatically picking the best model for the task.

## The "Double Router" Pattern

PearAI routes on the **Client** (Choosing the model).
Cencori routes on the **Server** (Choosing the provider).

This is a powerful combination:
1.  **PearAI** decides: "I need a *Reasoning* model for this complex refactor." -> Selects `deepseek-reasoner`.
2.  **Cencori** receives the request for `deepseek-reasoner`.
3.  **Cencori** routes it: "DeepSeek API is down, failing over to `fireworks-ai/deepseek-v3`."

You get the smart UX of PearAI with the reliability/failover of Cencori.

## Setup

In PearAI settings:
1.  Look for **"OpenAI Compatible Endpoint"**.
2.  Base URL: `https://cencori.com/v1`
3.  API Key: `csk_...`
