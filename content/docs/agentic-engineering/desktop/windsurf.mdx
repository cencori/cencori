Windsurf ([codeium.com/windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf)) (by Codeium) focuses on keeping you in the "Flow" with its deeply integrated **Cascade** agent.

## Cascade Setup

Cascade maintains deep awareness of your codebase. To teach it Cencori:

1.  Open the **Cascade** chat.
2.  Type: `@https://cencori.com/llm.txt`
3.  Cascade will ingest the documentation context.

## Flows

You can create a "Flow" for implementing AI features:

1.  **Prompt**: "Scaffold a Cencori-powered backend."
2.  **Cascade Actions**:
    *   Generates `lib/cencori.ts` (Client initialization).
    *   Creates `.env` file for `CENCORI_API_KEY`.
    *   Sets up an API route for chat.

## Visualizing with Windsurf
Because Windsurf understands your whole project, you can ask it:
> "Check my `app/api/chat/route.ts` and verify if I am correctly handling the Cencori `tool-calling` response."

Cascade will verify your implementation against the `llm.txt` patterns it ingested.
