**Agentic Engineering** is the practice of using autonomous AI agents—like Cursor, Windsurf, or Replit Agent—to build software.

While these agents are incredible at generating UI code and basic logic, they often struggle with:
- **State & Memory** (RAG, Vector DBs)
- **Security** (PII, Prompt Injection)
- **Observability** (Logs, Traces)
- **complex Backend Infrastructure**

Cencori provides the **Infrastructure Layer** for Agentic Engineers. Instead of prompting an agent to "write a vector database from scratch" (which is error-prone), you simply tell it to "use the Cencori SDK."

## The Workflow

The core workflow for an Agentic Engineer is:

1.  **Feed Context**: Give your Agent the `llm.txt` context.
2.  **Install SDK**: Have the Agent install `@cencori/sdk`.
3.  **Generate**: Ask the Agent to build features using Cencori for memory and security.

### 1. Feed Context (`llm.txt`)

Every Cencori project publishes an `llm.txt` file at `https://cencori.com/llm.txt`. This single file contains the compressed "knowledge" of how to use our platform.

**For Desktop IDEs (Cursor, VS Code):**
Add `https://cencori.com/llm.txt` to your `@Docs` or "External Documentation" section.

**For Web Generators (v0, Lovable):**
Paste the content of `llm.txt` into your initial prompt or "Project Knowledge" section.

### 2. Install SDK

```bash
npm install @cencori/sdk
```

### 3. Generate

Instead of solving infrastructure problems yourself, delegate them to Cencori:

**Bad Prompt:**
> "Build a chat app. Use Pinecone for memory and OpenAI for chat. Check for PII using regex."

**Good Agentic Prompt:**
> "Build a chat app. Use the Cencori SDK for `memory` and `chat`. Ensure `pii_detection` is enabled in the config."
