## Getting Started

1. **Sign in** to your Cencori account at [cencori.com/scan](/scan)
2. **Connect GitHub** — Click "Import Project" and authorize the Cencori GitHub App
3. **Select a repository** — Choose which repos to scan from your connected organizations
4. **Run a scan** — Click "Scan Now" to analyze your codebase for security issues

## Dashboard Features

### Real-Time Scanning
Watch scan results appear in real-time as files are analyzed. The dashboard uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) to stream results as they're discovered.

### Scan History
View all previous scans for a project. Compare security scores over time and track your progress toward a cleaner codebase.

### Detailed Issue Reports
Click on any issue to see the affected file, line number, and matched pattern. Filter by severity (critical, high, medium, low) or type (secrets, PII, routes, vulnerabilities).

### Changelog Generation
Generate AI-powered changelogs from your commit history. Select a date range and the dashboard will analyze your commits and produce a formatted changelog.

### Project Settings
Configure scan settings, set up notifications, and manage team access for each project.
