## What are Security Incidents?

A security incident is any event where Cencori detects suspicious, malicious, or policy-violating activity in an AI request or response. All incidents are logged for review and compliance.

## Incident Types

| Type | Description | Default Action |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **PII Detection** | Personal data found in prompt | Block |
| **Prompt Injection** | Attempt to manipulate AI behavior | Block |
| **Content Filter** | Harmful content detected | Block |
| **Rate Limit** | Usage quota exceeded | Block |
| **Suspicious Pattern** | Unusual usage detected | Log |

## Severity Levels

### <span className="text-yellow-500">Low</span>
Minor policy violations or potential false positives. Review periodically.

### <span className="text-orange-500">Medium</span>
Clear policy violations but not urgent. Review weekly.

### <span className="text-red-500">High</span>
Serious violations like prompt injection attempts. Review immediately.

### <span className="text-purple-500">Critical</span>
Potential security breaches or coordinated attacks. Investigate urgently.

## Viewing Incidents in Dashboard

1. Navigate to your project dashboard
2. Click "Security" in the sidebar
3. View the incidents list with:
   - Incident ID
   - Type and severity
   - Timestamp
   - User/API key info
4. Click any incident to view full details

## Incident Details

Each incident record contains:
- **Incident ID:** Unique identifier for tracking
- **Timestamp:** Exact time of detection
- **Type:** PII, prompt injection, etc.
- **Severity:** Low, medium, high, critical
- **Request Context:** Model, user ID, project
- **Detection Details:** What triggered the incident
- **Action Taken:** Blocked, logged, or allowed
- **Redacted Prompt:** The input (with PII removed)

## Recommended Response Actions

### For Low Severity:
- Review monthly
- Look for patterns
- Adjust filter sensitivity if needed

### For Medium Severity:
- Review weekly
- Educate users if accidental
- Consider user warnings

### For High/Critical Severity:
- Investigate immediately
- Identify the user/source
- Consider account suspension
- Review security policies

## Incident Trends

The Security dashboard shows trends over time:
- Incidents per day/week/month
- Breakdown by type
- Severity distribution
- Top users/API keys flagged
- Geographic distribution (if available)

## Accessing Incidents via API

Fetch incidents programmatically for custom alerting. The dashboard uses a project-scoped endpoint:

```typescript
// GET /api/projects/{projectId}/security/incidents
const response = await fetch(
  'https://cencori.com/api/projects/proj_123/security/incidents?severity=high',
  {
    headers: {
      // Uses your authenticated dashboard session
      // (this endpoint is not part of the public API)
    }
  }
);

const { incidents } = await response.json();

incidents.forEach(incident => {
  console.log(`[${incident.severity}] ${incident.type} at ${incident.timestamp}`);
  
  if (incident.severity === 'critical') {
    // Send alert to Slack, PagerDuty, etc.
    sendAlert(incident);
  }
});
```

## Compliance and Audit Trails

Security incidents provide audit trails for compliance:
- **SOC 2:** Demonstrate security monitoring and incident response
- **GDPR:** Proof of data protection measures
- **HIPAA:** PHI access logging
- **ISO 27001:** Information security management

Export incident logs for auditor review in CSV or JSON format.

## Best Practices

- Review high/critical incidents within 24 hours.
- Set up email/Slack alerts for critical incidents.
- Document your incident response process.
- Train team members on recognizing attack patterns.
- Export logs monthly for compliance records.
- Use incident trends to improve security policies.
