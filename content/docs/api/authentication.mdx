## API Key Authentication

Cencori uses API keys to authenticate requests. Your API key identifies your project and determines which security policies and rate limits apply.

### Getting Your API Key
1. Log in to the [Cencori Dashboard](/dashboard)
2. Navigate to your project
3. Go to the **"API Keys"** tab
4. Click **"Generate New Key"**
5. Copy the key immediately (it won't be shown again)

> [!CAUTION]
> API keys are sensitive credentials. Never commit them to version control or expose them in client-side code.

## Using API Keys

Include your API key when initializing the Cencori SDK. The SDK automatically adds the necessary authentication headers to all requests.

### SDK Initialization
```typescript
import { Cencori } from "cencori";

export const cencori = new Cencori({
  apiKey: process.env.CENCORI_API_KEY!,
});
```

### Direct HTTP Requests (AI & Memory)
If you're making direct HTTP requests to the AI or Memory endpoints, include your API key in the `CENCORI_API_KEY` header:

```bash
curl https://cencori.com/api/ai/chat \
  -H "CENCORI_API_KEY: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

### Direct HTTP Requests (REST /api/v1)
For REST endpoints under `/api/v1`, use the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl https://cencori.com/api/v1/metrics?period=24h \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Environment Variables

Store your API keys in environment variables to keep them secure.

### Local Development (`.env`)
```bash
CENCORI_API_KEY=cen_your_api_key_here
```
Make sure to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file.

## Required Headers

When making direct API requests, include these headers:
- **AI & Memory endpoints:** `CENCORI_API_KEY: YOUR_API_KEY` (preferred). `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` is also accepted.
- **REST endpoints (`/api/v1/*`):** `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` (required)
- **Content-Type:** `application/json` (required for POST)

## Authentication Errors

| Status | Code | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| 401 | `INVALID_API_KEY` | Key is invalid or has been revoked. |
| 403 | `INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS` | Key lacks permission for this resource. |
| 429 | `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | You have exceeded the rate limit. |

## Security Best Practices
- **Never expose keys in client-side code.**
- **Use environment variables.**
- **Rotate keys regularly** (every 90 days recommended).
- **Revoke compromised keys immediately** in the dashboard.
- **Use separate keys** for different services and environments.
