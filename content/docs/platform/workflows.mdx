## The Core Concept

Cencori isn't just a database; it's the **Central Nervous System** for your AI agents. Workflows define how your agents react to the world.

A Workflow consists of 3 pillars:

1.  **Trigger**: The "Sense" (e.g., `user.signup`, `chat.message`, `daily.cron`).
2.  **Think**: The "Brain" (LLM processing, RAG lookup, Logic).
3.  **Action**: The "Hand" (Update Database, Send Email, Call Tool).

---

## Architecture

Cencori acts as the **Serverless Event Bus**. You don't need to manage queues, workers, or retries.

    B -->|Step 1| C[Research Company (LLM)]
    C -->|Step 2| D[Draft Email (LLM)]
    D -->|Step 3| E[Send Email (Tool)]
```

## Strategy: The "Observational Memory" Pattern 🧠

One of the most powerful uses of Workflows is building **Self-Evolving Memory**.

Standard RAG (Vector Search) is great for retrieving old facts. But it misses the "Gist" of a user. **Observational Memory** solves this by continuously summarizing the user's life into a "Dense Profile".

### How to Build it with Cencori

You don't need a complex multi-agent system. You just need **One Workflow**.

#### 1. The Trigger
Listen for every message the user sends.

```typescript
// On every chat message...
cencori.on('chat.message', async (event) => {
  // Fire and forget (don't block the user)
  await cencori.workflows.trigger('update-observational-memory', event);
});
```

#### 2. The Workflow (Observer Loop)

This runs in the background, invisible to the user.

1.  **Observe**: Ask an LLM to extract "Facts" from the last message.
    > *"Did the user mention a preference, a goal, or a new relationship?"*
2.  **Reflect**: Checks if this new fact contradicts or updates an old fact.
3.  **Persist**: Updates the `observational_profile` in Cencori Memory (Key-Value Store).

#### 3. The Result

When the user chats next time, you inject the **Profile** into the System Prompt.

```typescript
const profile = await cencori.memory.get('observational_profile', userId);

const systemPrompt = `
You are a helpful assistant.
Core User Profile:
${profile}
`;
```

### Why Cencori?
*   **Infrastructure-less**: You don't need to run a "Reflector Server". We run the background jobs.
*   **Hybrid Memory**: Combine **Observational** (The "Who") with **Vector** (The "What").
*   **Privacy Built-in**: All data flowing through the workflow is automatically scanned for PII by Cencori Security.

## Roadmap

**Workflows** is currently in **Private Beta**. We are rolling out:

*   **SDK Triggers**: Define workflows in code (`cencori.ts`).
*   **Visual Builder**: Drag-and-drop workflow editor.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop**: Pause a workflow and wait for human approval (e.g. "Approve this email").
