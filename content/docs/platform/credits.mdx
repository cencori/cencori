## How Credits Work

Cencori uses a prepaid credits system instead of monthly subscriptions. You purchase credits upfront and they're deducted as you use AI models.

1 credit = $1 USD. When you make a request, the cost is calculated and deducted from your organization's balance.

## Why Credits?

- **No Waste:** Only pay for what you use
- **No Subscriptions:** No monthly fees or commitments
- **Predictable Costs:** Know exactly what each request costs
- **Flexible Budgets:** Top up as needed
- **Transparent Pricing:** See provider cost + markup

## Pricing Model

Each request cost = Provider Cost + Cencori Markup

### Example Calculation
**Request:** GPT-4o, 1,000 input tokens, 500 output tokens

**Provider Cost (OpenAI):**
- Input: 1,000 tokens × $5.00 / 1M = $0.005
- Output: 500 tokens × $15.00 / 1M = $0.0075
- Total Provider: $0.0125

**Cencori Markup:** 20% = $0.0025

**Total Cost:** $0.015 (0.015 credits)

> [!NOTE]
> **Transparency**
> Your dashboard shows exact provider cost and Cencori markup for every request.

## Checking Your Balance

### In Dashboard
1. Go to your organization dashboard
2. Check the credits widget in the header
3. View transaction history for details

### Via API

```typescript
// get-balance.ts
const response = await fetch(
  'https://cencori.com/api/organizations/your-org/credits',
  {
    headers: {
      'CENCORI_API_KEY': process.env.CENCORI_API_KEY,
    },
  }
);

const { balance, currency } = await response.json();
console.log(`Balance: ${balance} ${currency}`); // Balance: 50.25 USD
```

## Low Balance Alerts

Cencori automatically alerts you when credits run low:

| Threshold | Alert | Action |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **$10 remaining** | Warning notification | Plan to top up soon |
| **$5 remaining** | Urgent notification | Top up immediately |
| **$0 remaining** | Service suspended | Requests blocked until top-up |

## Adding Credits

1. Go to your organization dashboard
2. Click "Add Credits" or "Top Up"
3. Choose amount (minimum $10)
4. Complete payment via Stripe
5. Credits added immediately

> [!TIP]
> **Auto-Recharge (Coming Soon)**
> Automatically top up your balance when it drops below a specific threshold.

## Cost Tracking

Every request shows detailed cost breakdown:

```json
{
  "id": "req_123",
  "model": "gpt-4o",
  "provider": "openai",
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 1000,
    "completion_tokens": 500,
    "total_tokens": 1500
  },
  "cost": {
    "provider_cost_usd": 0.0125,
    "cencori_markup_usd": 0.0025,
    "total_cost_usd": 0.015
  }
}
```

View aggregated costs in your analytics dashboard:
- Total cost per day/week/month
- Cost by provider
- Cost by model
- Cost by project
- Cost trends over time

## Optimizing Costs

### Use Cheaper Models
Gemini 2.5 Flash costs ~$0.50/1M tokens vs GPT-4o at ~$15/1M. Use cheaper models for simple tasks.

### Set Token Limits
Use `maxTokens` to prevent unexpectedly long responses.

### Cache Responses
For repeated queries, cache responses to avoid redundant API calls.

### Monitor Usage
Check analytics regularly to identify expensive patterns and optimize.

## Transaction History

View all credit transactions in your dashboard:
- Credit purchases (top-ups)
- Credit usage (requests)
- Refunds (if any)
- Timestamps and descriptions

Export transaction history for accounting:
- CSV export
- PDF invoices
- Date range filtering
