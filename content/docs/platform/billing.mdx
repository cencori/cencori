## Token Pricing

Cencori simplifies billing by consolidating all AI provider costs into a single invoice. We pass through model costs with a small markup to cover infrastructure reliability, unified logging, and security scanning.

### Markup Rates

- **OpenAI**: +50% (e.g., GPT-4o input: ~$3.75/1M tokens)
- **Anthropic**: +50%
- **Google Vertex**: +0% (Native pricing)
- **Custom Providers**: +0%

> [!NOTE]
> Markups cover the cost of the **Universal Proxy**, **PII Scanning**, **Prompt Injection Protection**, and **Compliance Logging** which run on every request.

## Spend Management

Prevent unexpected bills with our built-in budget controls.

### Monthly Budget
Set a soft limit to receive email alerts when your spending reaches **50%**, **80%**, and **100%** of your threshold.

### Hard Spend Cap
Set a hard limit (e.g., $500/mo). Once reached, Cencori will **block all AI requests** until the next billing cycle or until you increase the cap.

1. Go to **Settings > Billing**.
2. Enable **Enforce spend cap**.
3. Enter your maximum monthly amount.
