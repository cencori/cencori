## What Analytics Does Cencori Provide?

Cencori's analytics dashboard gives you complete visibility into your AI infrastructure:

- **Request Volume:** Track total requests and trends over time.
- **Cost Analysis:** Detailed breakdown of spend by model and provider.
- **Performance:** Monitor latency and success rates.
- **Security:** Track and visualize security incidents (PII, injections).
- **User Insights:** Analyze usage patterns by user ID or API key.

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Description | Goal |
|--------|-------------|------|
| **Total Requests** | Number of AI requests processed. | Monitor growth |
| **Success Rate** | Percentage of successful vs error responses. | > 99% |
| **Total Cost** | Cumulative spend (Provider + Markup). | Stay within budget |
| **Avg Latency** | Time from request to response. | < 2s for UI tasks |
| **Security Incidents** | Count of blocked or flagged requests. | Minimize threats |

## Charts and Visualizations

### Requests Over Time
Identify peak usage periods and long-term growth trends with our interactive line charts.

### Cost Breakdown
Pie and bar charts show you exactly where your budget is going. Compare costs across OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini models.

### Model Distribution
See which models are most popular in your application to help with model consolidation or migration decisions.

### Security Threat Map
Monitor the distribution of security incidents over time to identify coordinated prompt injection attacks or PII leakage trends.

## Filtering and Segmentation

Slice your data to find exactly what you're looking for:
- **Time Range:** Filter by last 24h, 7 days, 30 days, or custom ranges.
- **Model/Provider:** Compare performance and cost across different vendors.
- **API Key:** Track usage per developer, environment (staging/prod), or application.
- **User ID:** (Optional) If you pass user IDs, you can analyze behavior per user.

## Common Use Cases

### Performance Debugging
Find slow requests by filtering for high latency. Identify if specific models or provider regions are causing bottlenecks.

### Capacity Planning
Use request trends to forecast future usage and ensure your organization has enough credits.

### Security Auditing
Review spikes in security incidents to determine if they correlate with new deployments or external traffic shifts.

## Accessing Analytics via API

Fetch metrics programmatically for your own internal dashboards using the Metrics API (`/api/v1/metrics`):

```typescript
// fetch-analytics.ts
const response = await fetch(
  'https://cencori.com/api/v1/metrics?period=24h',
  {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${CENCORI_API_KEY}`
    }
  }
);

const { data } = await response.json();
// data includes request counts, cost, latency, and breakdowns by provider/model
```

## Best Practices
- **Review weekly:** Set a recurring task to check your cost and success rate trends.
- **Set Alerts:** Configure low-balance and cost-threshold alerts to avoid surprises.
- **Track versions:** Use different API keys for different versions of your app to compare their efficiency.
- **Share reports:** Export analytics views to share with your security or finance teams.
