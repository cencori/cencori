## What are Audit Logs?

Audit logs are immutable records of every AI request processed through Cencori. They provide complete traceability for compliance, security investigations, and performance optimization.

## What Gets Logged

Cencori logs a comprehensive set of metadata for every interaction:

### Request Information
- Complete prompt text
- Model and parameters (temperature, max_tokens)
- API key used
- User/session identifier
- Timestamp (millisecond precision)
- IP address

### Response Information
- AI-generated content
- Token usage (input/output/total)
- Cost calculation
- Latency metrics
- Provider used
- Status code (success/error)

### Security Metadata
- PII detection results
- Content filter flags
- Prompt injection score
- Security incidents linked

## Log Retention

Retention periods vary based on your plan:

| Plan | Retention Period | Export Available |
|------|------------------|------------------|
| **Free** | 7 days | No |
| **Pro** | 30 days | CSV |
| **Enterprise** | 1 year+ | CSV, JSON, API |

> [!NOTE]
> After the retention period, logs are permanently deleted. Export important logs before they expire.

## Viewing Logs in Dashboard

1. Navigate to your project in the [dashboard](/dashboard)
2. Click **"Logs"** in the sidebar
3. Use filters to narrow results:
    - Date range
    - Model
    - Status (success/error)
    - API key
    - Cost range
4. Click any log entry to view full details

## Searching Logs

Search through logs using full-text search to:
- Find specific keywords in prompts
- Identify all requests from a specific user
- Locate expensive queries (high token usage)
- Debug failed requests by error message

## Accessing via API

You can fetch logs programmatically using our API:

```typescript
// fetch-logs.ts
const response = await fetch(
  'https://api.cencori.com/v1/projects/proj_123/logs?' +
  'start_date=2024-01-01&model=gpt-4o&limit=100',
  {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${CENCORI_API_KEY}`
    }
  }
);

const { logs } = await response.json();

logs.forEach(log => {
  console.log(`[${log.timestamp}] ${log.model}: ${log.total_tokens} tokens, $${log.cost_usd}`);
});
```

## Exporting Logs

Export logs for archival or external analysis:

### CSV Export (Pro+)
Download as CSV for Excel/Google Sheets analysis. Includes all fields except full prompt text (for PII protection).

### JSON Export (Enterprise)
Complete log data including prompts and responses. Useful for data warehouses or custom analysis.

### Scheduled Exports (Enterprise)
Automatically export logs to S3, BigQuery, or Snowflake daily/weekly.

## Compliance Use Cases

- **SOC 2 Compliance:** Demonstrate access controls and monitoring. Auditors can review who accessed what AI models and when.
- **GDPR Right of Access:** When users request their data, search logs by user ID to find all their AI interactions.
- **HIPAA Audit Trails:** Track all access to protected health information (PHI) for compliance reporting.
- **Forensic Investigation:** If a security incident occurs, trace the exact sequence of events using timestamps and request IDs.

## Best Practices

- Export logs monthly for long-term archival
- Use search to identify expensive or slow queries
- Review error logs weekly to catch issues early
- Set up alerts for unusual patterns (cost spikes, error rate increases)
- Document your log retention policy for compliance
- Redact sensitive data before sharing logs with third parties
