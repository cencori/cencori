# Agents

Cencori **Agent Foundry** lets you connect any autonomous agent to your infrastructure. All agents include **Shadow Mode** protection and can be configured, monitored, and controlled from a single dashboard.

Cencori is **not** the agent — it's the **brain**. Your agent runs locally (or in the cloud), and Cencori provides model routing, billing, safety controls, and monitoring via a standard OpenAI-compatible API.

## Available Blueprints

### OpenClaw

The autonomous desktop operator. OpenClaw controls your mouse, keyboard, and browser to automate complex local tasks.

**Best for**: Desktop automation, file management, browser-based workflows.

```bash
# Install
curl -sSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash

# Connect to Cencori
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://cencori.com/api/v1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=cake_your_key_here
# Optional: for multi-agent routing overrides
export CENCORI_AGENT_ID=your_agent_id

# Run
openclaw onboard
```

**Capabilities**:
- Full desktop control (mouse, keyboard, screenshots)
- File system access and management
- Application interaction and automation

> [!NOTE]
> `CENCORI_AGENT_ID` is optional. Cencori derives the agent from the API key by default.

### n8n Workflow

Build custom AI agents visually using n8n's low-code workflow automation platform. Connect to 300+ apps without writing code.

**Best for**: Multi-app automation, data pipelines, event-driven workflows.

```bash
# Install
npx n8n

# Connect to Cencori
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://cencori.com/api/v1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=cake_your_key_here
```

**Capabilities**:
- Visual workflow builder with drag-and-drop nodes
- LangChain integration for advanced AI chains
- 300+ pre-built app integrations (Slack, GitHub, Notion, etc.)

---

### AutoGPT

The original autonomous agent. AutoGPT recursively improves its own prompts and reasoning to achieve complex, multi-step goals.

**Best for**: Open-ended research, long-running autonomous tasks.

```bash
# Install
pip install autogpt

# Connect to Cencori
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://cencori.com/api/v1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=cake_your_key_here

# Run
autogpt run
```

**Capabilities**:
- Recursive self-improvement and task decomposition
- Long-term memory across sessions
- Internet access for real-time research

---

### CrewAI

Orchestrate a team of role-based agents that collaborate on complex projects. Each agent has a specialized role and delegates tasks to others.

**Best for**: Multi-agent collaboration, complex project execution.

```bash
# Install
pip install crewai

# Connect to Cencori
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://cencori.com/api/v1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=cake_your_key_here
```

**Capabilities**:
- Role-based agent assignment (Researcher, Writer, Reviewer, etc.)
- Automatic task delegation and sequencing
- Collaborative output synthesis

---

### Python Sandbox

A secure, sandboxed environment for executing Python code generated by LLMs. Ideal for data analysis and visualization tasks.

**Best for**: Data analysis, code execution, generating charts and reports.

```bash
# Install
pip install openai

# Connect to Cencori
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://cencori.com/api/v1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=cake_your_key_here
```

**Capabilities**:
- Isolated code execution with resource limits
- Data analysis with pandas, numpy, matplotlib
- Automatic visualization generation

---

### Custom Agent

Build your own agent from scratch. Any tool that supports a custom OpenAI base URL works with Cencori out of the box.

**Best for**: Specialized use cases, proprietary workflows, experimentation.

```bash
# Connect any OpenAI-compatible agent to Cencori
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://cencori.com/api/v1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=cake_your_key_here
# Optional: force a specific agent when needed
export CENCORI_AGENT_ID=your_agent_id
```

**Compatible with**: OpenHands, Aider, Continue, LangChain, LlamaIndex, SillyTavern, and any tool that supports custom OpenAI endpoints.

## Shadow Mode

All agents include **Shadow Mode**, a proactive safety layer that:

1. **Intercepts** tool calls from the LLM before they execute.
2. **Inserts** them as pending actions in the dashboard Live Feed.
3. **Waits** for your approval before the agent proceeds.

Toggle Shadow Mode on or off from the agent's configuration page.

## Configuration

From the **Configuration** tab you can:

- **Switch Models** instantly (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Claude 3.5, etc.)
- **Edit the System Prompt** to refine the agent's behavior
- **Generate & Roll API Keys** for secure authentication
- **Delete** agents you no longer need
