# OpenClaw

**OpenClaw** is an autonomous desktop operator that controls your mouse, keyboard, and browser. It runs as a local daemon on your machine and connects to the Cencori Brain for model routing, configuration, and real-time monitoring.

> [!TIP]
> OpenClaw is model-agnostic. It uses Cencori as its "Remote Brain," meaning you can switch between GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude, and more from the dashboard—without touching the local agent.

## Quick Start

### 1. Deploy from the Marketplace

Navigate to **Agents → Agent Marketplace** in your project dashboard and click **Deploy Agent** on the OpenClaw card.

### 2. Generate an API Key

Go to the agent's **Configuration** tab and click **Generate Key**. Copy the key—you'll only see it once.

### 3. Install OpenClaw

Install the OpenClaw agent on your machine:

```bash
curl -sSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash
```

> [!NOTE]
> Works on macOS, Windows & Linux. Supports npm (`npm i -g openclaw`) and Docker installs too — see [openclaw.ai](https://openclaw.ai) for details.

### 4. Connect to Cencori

Set these environment variables so OpenClaw uses Cencori as its backend:

```bash
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://cencori.com/api/v1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=cake_your_key_here
# Optional: override auto-detection for multi-agent setups
export CENCORI_AGENT_ID=your_agent_id
```

Then start the agent:

```bash
openclaw onboard
```

Cencori acts as the **remote brain** — OpenClaw sends requests here instead of directly to OpenAI or Google. The dashboard shows your agent as **"Online"** once the first request arrives.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `CENCORI_AGENT_ID` is optional for standard OpenAI-compatible clients (including OpenClaw).  
> Cencori derives the agent from the API key automatically. Set `CENCORI_AGENT_ID` only when you want to force routing to a specific agent.

### Alternative: OpenClaw `models.providers` config

If you prefer OpenClaw's provider config (`~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`) instead of environment variables, configure Cencori like this:

```json
{
  "models": {
    "providers": {
      "cencori": {
        "baseUrl": "https://cencori.com/api/v1",
        "apiKey": "cake_your_key_here",
        "api": "openai-completions"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This works without an `X-Agent-ID` header. Cencori resolves the agent from the API key automatically.

Use raw model IDs in OpenClaw (for example `gemini-2.5-flash` or `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`).
`cencori/<model>` aliases are also accepted for compatibility, but raw IDs are recommended.

### 5. Monitor & Control

Switch to the **Live Feed** tab to watch the agent's activity in real-time. If **Shadow Mode** is enabled, you'll be prompted to approve or reject risky actions before they execute.

## Capabilities

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Desktop Control** | Full mouse and keyboard automation |
| **Browser Automation** | Navigate, click, fill forms, extract data |
| **File System** | Read, write, move, and delete files |
| **App Interaction** | Launch and control desktop applications |
| **Screenshot Capture** | Visual state streaming to the dashboard |

## Configuration

All configuration is managed from the Cencori Dashboard—no local `.env` files needed.

### Model Selection

Choose any supported model from the **Configuration** tab:

- **OpenAI**: GPT-4o, GPT-4o Mini
- **Google**: Gemini 2.0 Flash, Gemini 1.5 Pro
- **Anthropic**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3.5 Haiku
- **DeepSeek**: DeepSeek Chat, DeepSeek Reasoner

The agent picks up the new model on its next heartbeat without requiring a restart.

### System Prompt

Customize the agent's persona and instructions from the **System Prompt** editor. For example:

```
You are a desktop assistant focused on file organization.
Only modify files within the ~/Documents directory.
Always ask before deleting anything.
```

### Shadow Mode

When enabled, Shadow Mode intercepts potentially dangerous actions:

- **Terminal commands** (e.g., `rm -rf`, `sudo`)
- **File deletions** or moves outside safe directories
- **External network requests** to unknown domains

Each intercepted action appears in the Live Feed with **Approve** / **Reject** buttons.

## Security

| Mechanism | Detail |
|---|---|
| **API Key Auth** | All requests authenticated with `cake_` prefixed keys |
| **Agent Resolution** | Agent is auto-resolved from API key; `X-Agent-ID` / `CENCORI_AGENT_ID` is optional |
| **Key Hashing** | Raw keys are never stored; only SHA-256 hashes |
| **Shadow Mode** | Human-in-the-loop approval for risky operations |
| **RLS Policies** | Database-level access control per organization |

## Troubleshooting

### Agent stuck on "Waiting for connection"
- Verify your API key is correct and not expired
- Check that your machine can reach `https://cencori.com/api/v1/`
- Regenerate the key from Configuration if needed
- If using `CENCORI_AGENT_ID`, confirm it matches the agent shown in the Configuration tab

### HTTP 405 from OpenClaw
- Set provider `baseUrl` to `https://<your-domain>/api/v1` (not `/api/v1/chat/completions`)
- Keep `api` set to `openai-completions` so OpenClaw calls the correct endpoint
- Use a raw model ID like `gemini-2.5-flash` if your provider setup is strict about model names

### Agent not picking up new model
- The agent syncs config on each heartbeat (every 30 seconds)
- Force a refresh by restarting the local daemon

### Shadow Mode not triggering
- Ensure Shadow Mode is toggled **on** in the Live Feed sidebar
- Check the agent's system prompt isn't overriding safety instructions
