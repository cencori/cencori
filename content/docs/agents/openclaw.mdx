# OpenClaw

**OpenClaw** is an autonomous desktop operator that controls your mouse, keyboard, and browser. It runs as a local daemon on your machine and connects to the Cencori Brain for model routing, configuration, and real-time monitoring.

> [!TIP]
> OpenClaw is model-agnostic. It uses Cencori as its "Remote Brain," meaning you can switch between GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude, and more from the dashboard—without touching the local agent.

## Quick Start

### 1. Deploy from the Marketplace

Navigate to **Agents → Agent Marketplace** in your project dashboard and click **Deploy Agent** on the OpenClaw card.

### 2. Generate an API Key

Go to the agent's **Configuration** tab and click **Generate Key**. Copy the key—you'll only see it once.

### 3. Connect Your Machine

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx openclaw connect --key=cake_your_key_here
```

This connects your local machine to the Cencori Brain. The agent will appear as **"Online"** in the dashboard.

### 4. Monitor & Control

Switch to the **Live Feed** tab to watch the agent's activity in real-time. If **Shadow Mode** is enabled, you'll be prompted to approve or reject risky actions before they execute.

## Capabilities

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Desktop Control** | Full mouse and keyboard automation |
| **Browser Automation** | Navigate, click, fill forms, extract data |
| **File System** | Read, write, move, and delete files |
| **App Interaction** | Launch and control desktop applications |
| **Screenshot Capture** | Visual state streaming to the dashboard |

## Configuration

All configuration is managed from the Cencori Dashboard—no local `.env` files needed.

### Model Selection

Choose any supported model from the **Configuration** tab:

- **OpenAI**: GPT-4o, GPT-4o Mini
- **Google**: Gemini 2.0 Flash, Gemini 1.5 Pro
- **Anthropic**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3.5 Haiku
- **DeepSeek**: DeepSeek Chat, DeepSeek Reasoner

The agent picks up the new model on its next heartbeat without requiring a restart.

### System Prompt

Customize the agent's persona and instructions from the **System Prompt** editor. For example:

```
You are a desktop assistant focused on file organization.
Only modify files within the ~/Documents directory.
Always ask before deleting anything.
```

### Shadow Mode

When enabled, Shadow Mode intercepts potentially dangerous actions:

- **Terminal commands** (e.g., `rm -rf`, `sudo`)
- **File deletions** or moves outside safe directories
- **External network requests** to unknown domains

Each intercepted action appears in the Live Feed with **Approve** / **Reject** buttons.

## Security

| Mechanism | Detail |
|---|---|
| **API Key Auth** | All requests authenticated with `cake_` prefixed keys |
| **Key Hashing** | Raw keys are never stored; only SHA-256 hashes |
| **Shadow Mode** | Human-in-the-loop approval for risky operations |
| **RLS Policies** | Database-level access control per organization |

## Troubleshooting

### Agent stuck on "Waiting for connection"
- Verify your API key is correct and not expired
- Check that your machine can reach `https://cencori.com/api/v1/`
- Regenerate the key from Configuration if needed

### Agent not picking up new model
- The agent syncs config on each heartbeat (every 30 seconds)
- Force a refresh by restarting the local daemon

### Shadow Mode not triggering
- Ensure Shadow Mode is toggled **on** in the Live Feed sidebar
- Check the agent's system prompt isn't overriding safety instructions
