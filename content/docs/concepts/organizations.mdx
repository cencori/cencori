## What is an Organization?

An organization is the top-level container in Cencori. It contains:
- Multiple projects (your AI applications)
- Team members with different roles
- Billing and credit balance
- Custom provider configurations
- Shared security policies

## Organization Structure

```text

├── Projects
├── Production API
├── Staging API
└── Development
├── Team Members
├── Owner (Full access)
├── Admins (Manage projects, view billing)
└── Members (Access projects)
├── Custom Providers
└── Billing
```

## Creating an Organization

When you first sign up to Cencori, a personal organization is automatically created for you. You can create additional organizations for different teams or companies.

### Steps to Create:
1. Click your profile in the top-right corner
2. Select "Create Organization"
3. Enter organization name and description
4. Click "Create"

## User Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full organization control, manage billing, delete org, manage all projects, invite/remove members |
| **Admin** | Create/manage projects, view billing, invite members, manage custom providers. Cannot delete org |
| **Member** | Access assigned projects, view logs, generate keys. Cannot view billing or manage team |

## Inviting Team Members

1. Go to your organization settings
2. Click "Team" in the sidebar
3. Click "Invite Member"
4. Enter their email address
5. Select their role (Admin or Member)
6. Click "Send Invitation"

The invited user will receive an email with an invitation link. They must accept the invitation to join your organization.

## Switching Between Organizations

If you're a member of multiple organizations:
1. Click the organization name in the top-left corner
2. Select from the dropdown list
3. The dashboard will refresh with the new organization's data

## Billing and Credits

Each organization has its own:
- Credit balance
- Billing history
- Payment methods
- Usage reports

Credits are not shared between organizations. If you create multiple organizations, you'll need to add credits to each one separately.

## Organization Settings

### General
- Organization name
- Description
- Organization slug (URL identifier)

### Team
- View all members
- Pending invitations
- Manage roles
- Remove members

### Billing
- Current balance
- Add credits
- Transaction history
- Payment methods

### Danger Zone
- Delete organization (owner only)
- Transfer ownership

## Best Practices

- Create separate organizations for completely different businesses or clients
- Use projects within an organization to separate environments (dev, staging, prod)
- Assign the minimum required role to team members (principle of least privilege)
- Regularly review team members and remove those who no longer need access
- Set up billing alerts to avoid unexpected charges
