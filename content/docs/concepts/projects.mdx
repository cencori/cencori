## What are Projects?

Projects are the primary way to organize your AI applications in Cencori. Each project has its own API keys, security policies, rate limits, and usage analytics. This allows you to keep different applications or environments completely separate.

- **Isolation:** Each project has its own API keys and configuration
- **Organization:** Group related AI features into a single project
- **Analytics:** Track usage and costs per project
- **Collaboration:** Invite team members to specific projects

## Creating Projects

Create a new project from the Cencori dashboard in just a few steps:

### Step-by-Step Guide
1. Log in to your [Cencori dashboard](/dashboard)
2. Click the **"Create Project"** button in the top navigation
3. Enter a descriptive project name (e.g., "Production App", "Development")
4. Optionally add a description to help identify the project's purpose
5. Select your organization (if you belong to multiple)
6. Click **"Create"** to finish

> [!TIP]
> Create separate projects for development, staging, and production environments to keep your data and metrics isolated.

## API Key Management

API keys authenticate your application with Cencori. Each project can have multiple API keys for different purposes.

### Generating API Keys
1. Navigate to your project in the dashboard
2. Go to the **"API Keys"** tab
3. Click **"Generate New Key"**
4. Give your key a descriptive name (e.g., "Production Server", "Mobile App")
5. Copy the key immediately - it won't be shown again for security

```bash
# Store your API key securely
CENCORI_API_KEY=cen_prod_abc123xyz456
```

### Key Naming Best Practices
- Use descriptive names that indicate where the key is used
- Include the environment (e.g., "Production Web Server")
- Date the key if you plan to rotate regularly (e.g., "API Key - Jan 2025")
- Avoid generic names like "Key 1" or "Test Key"

### Revoking API Keys
If a key is compromised or no longer needed, you can revoke it immediately from the dashboard. Revoked keys cannot be used to make requests.

```text
Error: Invalid API key
Status: 401 Unauthorized
Message: The provided API key has been revoked or does not exist.
```

### Key Rotation
For enhanced security, rotate your API keys regularly:
1. Generate a new API key in the dashboard
2. Update your application to use the new key
3. Deploy the changes
4. Verify the new key is working
5. Revoke the old key

## Environment Separation

Cencori supports test and production environments within each project, allowing you to develop and test safely without affecting production data.

### Test vs Production Keys
- **Production keys** start with `cen` - use these in live applications
- **Test keys** start with `cen_test_` - use these during development

### Environment Configuration

```bash
# .env.development
CENCORI_API_KEY=cen_test_abc123xyz456
```

```bash
# .env.production
CENCORI_API_KEY=cen_xyz789abc123
```

> [!NOTE]
> Test keys have lower rate limits and don't incur charges, making them perfect for development and testing.

## Team Collaboration

Invite team members to collaborate on projects with role-based access control.

### Team Roles
- **Owner:** Full access including project deletion and billing
- **Admin:** Can manage settings, keys, and team members
- **Developer:** Can view logs and analytics, generate API keys
- **Viewer:** Read-only access to logs and analytics

### Inviting Team Members
1. Go to the **"Team"** tab in your project
2. Click **"Invite Member"**
3. Enter their email address
4. Select their role
5. Click **"Send Invitation"**

## Project Settings

Configure various settings to control how your project operates.

### Rate Limits
Set request limits to prevent abuse and control costs:
- Requests per minute/hour/day
- Token usage limits
- Per-user limits (if using user identification)
- Budget caps and spending alerts

### Security Policies
Configure project-wide security settings:
- Enable/disable PII filtering
- Set content moderation thresholds
- Configure custom security rules
- Whitelist/blacklist specific patterns

### Provider Configuration
Add and manage AI provider API keys:
- OpenAI API key
- Anthropic API key
- Google AI API key
- Custom endpoint configurations

### Integrations
Connect your project to external tools:
- Slack notifications for security incidents
- Webhook endpoints for real-time events
- Data warehouse exports (Snowflake, BigQuery)
- Monitoring tools (Datadog, Prometheus)

## Deleting Projects

If you no longer need a project, you can delete it from the project settings. This action is irreversible and will:
- Revoke all API keys associated with the project
- Delete all logs and analytics data
- Remove all team member access
- Cancel any active integrations

> [!CAUTION]
> Project deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. Export any important data before deleting a project.
