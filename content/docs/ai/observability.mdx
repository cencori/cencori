Cencori provides a complete observability stack out-of-the-box, eliminating the need for external tools like LangSmith or Helicone for most use cases.

## Request Logs

Every request sent through the gateway is logged with granular detail.

- **Inputs/Outputs**: Full prompt and completion text.
- **Metadata**: Latency, TTFT (Time to First Token), Provider, Model.
- **Cost**: Calculated based on provider pricing (automatically updated).
- **Status**: Success, Failure, or Content Verification flags.

To view logs, navigate to **Dashboard > Logs**. You can filter by:
- `status` (e.g., `error`, `success`)
- `model` (e.g., `gpt-4o`)
- `metadata.user_id`

## Traces

For complex workflows (Agents, RAG), Cencori stitches individual requests into a **Trace**.

- **Root Span**: The initial user request.
- **Child Spans**: Tool calls, embedding generation, or retrieval steps.
- **Visualization**: A Gantt-chart view of the entire chain execution.

To enable tracing, simpy pass a `trace_id` header or use the `parent_id` parameter in our SDKs (auto-handled by LangChain integration).

## Cost Tracking & Analytics

The **Dashboard > Analytics** tab provides high-level insights:

- **Total Spend**: Daily/Monthly breakdown.
- **Volume**: Request count and token throughput.
- **Latency P95/P99**: Identify slow providers or regions.
- **Error Rate**: Monitor stability.

## Data Export (Enterprise)

You can export your raw log data to your own data warehouse.

- **S3 Bucket**: JSONL files delivered hourly.
- **Datadog**: Real-time log streaming.
- **BigQuery / Snowflake**: Direct sync.

Contact sales to enable Data Export.
