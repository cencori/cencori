Today marks the official launch of Cencori's API Gateway—the foundation for everything we're building.

## What's Included

### Multi-Provider Support

One API for all major AI providers:

```typescript
// OpenAI
{ model: 'gpt-4o' }

// Anthropic
{ model: 'claude-3-opus' }

// Google Gemini
{ model: 'gemini-2.5-flash' }
```

### Security Scanning

Every request is scanned in real-time:

- **PII Detection** — Automatically detect sensitive information
- **Prompt Injection Protection** — Block malicious inputs
- **Content Filtering** — Enforce your content policies

### Complete Observability

Full visibility into your AI operations:

- **Request Logs** — Every prompt and response with metadata
- **Analytics Dashboard** — Usage trends, costs, and performance
- **Audit Logs** — Compliance-ready logging for every request

### Real-Time Streaming

Server-Sent Events for real-time responses. Better UX, reduced perceived latency.

## Getting Started

1. Sign up at [cencori.com/dashboard](/dashboard)
2. Create a project and generate an API key
3. Make your first request

That's it. You now have security, monitoring, and multi-provider support built in.
