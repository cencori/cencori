We're testing edge runtime support for Pro tier users.

## Early Benchmarks

| Region | Before (Origin) | After (Edge) | Improvement |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| US West | 120ms | 45ms | 63% faster |
| EU Central | 180ms | 55ms | 69% faster |
| Asia Pacific | 250ms | 70ms | 72% faster |

## How It Works

Requests automatically route to the nearest edge node. No code changes required—just enable it in your project settings.

## What's Included

- **Edge runtime support** for low-latency regions
- **Automatic request routing** to nearest edge node
- **Preview available** for Pro tier users

Currently in beta. Full release coming in Q1 2026.
