Today marks an important milestone for Cencori. After months of development and feedback from early users, we're officially launching our platform to help developers and companies build secure, reliable AI applications.

## Who We Are

Cencori is the infrastructure for AI production. We provide the platform layer that sits between your application and AI providers, handling security, multi-provider routing, and comprehensive observability — so you can focus on building your product.

Our mission is simple: make AI applications production-ready from day one. We believe every AI application deserves enterprise-grade security, monitoring, and compliance capabilities — regardless of company size or development stage.

## The Challenge

As AI applications transition from prototypes to production systems, development teams encounter critical infrastructure challenges that can delay launches, increase costs, and create security vulnerabilities.

### Security Threats

AI applications face unique security threats that traditional security tools weren't designed to handle:

- **Prompt Injection Attacks** - Malicious users manipulating AI behavior through crafted inputs
- **Data Leakage** - Sensitive information inadvertently exposed in prompts or responses  
- **Jailbreak Attempts** - Users bypassing content policies and safety guardrails
- **Model Abuse** - Unauthorized access patterns and usage anomalies

A single prompt injection can compromise your entire AI application. Traditional WAFs and security tools cannot detect or prevent these AI-specific attacks.

### Infrastructure Complexity  

Managing multiple AI providers creates operational overhead:

- Different APIs, authentication methods, and request formats
- Complex failover logic when primary providers experience downtime
- Rate limiting across multiple provider quotas
- Cost tracking scattered across multiple billing systems

### Compliance Requirements

Production AI applications must meet strict compliance standards:

- Audit logs for every AI request and response
- Data retention policies for regulatory compliance
- Security incident tracking and reporting
- Usage attribution for cost allocation

Building this infrastructure in-house typically requires months of engineering time - time better spent on your core product.

## Our Solution

Cencori provides a complete infrastructure platform for AI applications, handling security, routing, and observability so your team can focus on building features.

### Real-Time Security

Our security layer analyzes every request in real-time before it reaches your AI models:

**Prompt Injection Detection** - Machine learning models trained on thousands of attack patterns to identify and block malicious prompts.

**PII Detection & Redaction** - Automatically detect and optionally redact sensitive information like emails, phone numbers, and credit cards.

**Content Filtering** - Customizable filters to enforce your content policies across all AI interactions.

**Anomaly Detection** - Real-time monitoring of usage patterns to identify potential abuse or security incidents.

Security checks run in milliseconds, adding negligible latency while providing comprehensive protection against AI-specific threats.

### Unified AI Gateway

A single API endpoint that connects to all major AI providers:

```typescript
// One simple API call
const response = await fetch('https://cencori.com/api/ai/chat', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'CENCORI_API_KEY': process.env.CENCORI_API_KEY,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: 'gpt-4o',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: userPrompt }]
  })
});
```

Switch between providers by simply changing the model parameter:

```typescript
// OpenAI GPT-4
{ model: 'gpt-4o' }

// Anthropic Claude
{ model: 'claude-3-opus' }

// Google Gemini  
{ model: 'gemini-2.5-flash' }
```

No need to maintain separate SDKs, authentication logic, or error handling for each provider.

### Complete Observability

Every request flows through Cencori, giving you complete visibility into your AI operations:

- **Request Logs** - Full request and response data with metadata
- **Analytics Dashboard** - Usage trends, costs, and performance metrics
- **Security Incidents** - Real-time alerts when threats are detected
- **Cost Attribution** - Track spending by user, feature, or team

When something goes wrong in production, having detailed logs of every AI interaction is invaluable. Cencori makes debugging AI applications as straightforward as debugging traditional APIs.

## Who We Serve

Cencori is designed for development teams building AI-powered applications across various industries and use cases.

### AI-First Companies

## Getting Started

Integrating Cencori into your application takes minutes.

### Step 1: Create Your Account

Sign up at [cencori.com/signup](/signup) and create your first project. The free tier includes 1,000 requests per month - perfect for development and testing.

### Step 2: Add Your Provider Keys

In your project settings, add API keys for the AI providers you want to use. Cencori securely stores these credentials and uses them to make requests on your behalf.

### Step 3: Make Your First Request

Replace your existing AI provider calls with a simple fetch to our unified endpoint:

```typescript
const response = await fetch('https://cencori.com/api/ai/chat', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'CENCORI_API_KEY': process.env.CENCORI_API_KEY,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: 'gpt-4o',
    messages: [
      { role: 'system', content: 'You are a helpful assistant.' },
      { role: 'user', content: userInput }
    ]
  })
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data.choices[0].message.content);
```
