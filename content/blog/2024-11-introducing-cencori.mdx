Today marks an important milestone for Cencori. After months of development and feedback from early users, we're officially launching our platform to help developers and companies build secure, reliable AI applications.

## Who We Are

Cencori is a security and monitoring platform purpose-built for AI applications. We provide the infrastructure layer that sits between your application and AI providers, offering real-time threat detection, multi-provider routing, and comprehensive observability.

Our mission is simple: **make AI applications production-ready from day one**.

<Callout type="info" title="Our Vision">
We believe every AI application deserves enterprise-grade security, monitoring, and compliance capabilities - regardless of company size or development stage.
</Callout>

## The Challenge We're Solving

As AI applications transition from prototypes to production systems, development teams encounter critical infrastructure challenges that can delay launches, increase costs, and create security vulnerabilities.

### Security Vulnerabilities

AI applications face unique security threats that traditional security tools weren't designed to handle:

- **Prompt Injection Attacks** - Malicious users manipulating AI behavior through crafted inputs
- **Data Leakage** - Sensitive information inadvertently exposed in prompts or responses  
- **Jailbreak Attempts** - Users bypassing content policies and safety guardrails
- **Model Abuse** - Unauthorized access patterns and usage anomalies

<Callout type="warn" title="The Reality">
A single prompt injection can compromise your entire AI application. Traditional WAFs and security tools cannot detect or prevent these AI-specific attacks.
</Callout>

### Infrastructure Complexity  

Managing multiple AI providers creates operational overhead:

- Different APIs, authentication methods, and request formats
- Complex failover logic when primary providers experience downtime
- Rate limiting across multiple provider quotas
- Cost tracking scattered across multiple billing systems

### Compliance Requirements

Production AI applications must meet strict compliance standards:

- Audit logs for every AI request and response
- Data retention policies for regulatory compliance
- Security incident tracking and reporting
- Usage attribution for cost allocation

Building this infrastructure in-house typically requires months of engineering time - time better spent on your core product.

## Our Solution

Cencori provides a complete infrastructure platform for AI applications, handling security, routing, and observability so your team can focus on building features.

### Security First

Our security layer analyzes every request in real-time before it reaches your AI models:

<Cards>
  <Card title="Prompt Injection Detection">
    Machine learning models trained on thousands of attack patterns to identify and block malicious prompts
  </Card>
  <Card title="PII Detection & Redaction">
    Automatically detect and optionally redact sensitive information like emails, phone numbers, and credit cards
  </Card>
  <Card title="Content Filtering">
    Customizable filters to enforce your content policies across all AI interactions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Anomaly Detection">
    Real-time monitoring of usage patterns to identify potential abuse or security incidents
  </Card>
</Cards>

<Callout type="success" title="Real-Time Protection">
Security checks run in milliseconds, adding negligible latency while providing comprehensive protection against AI-specific threats.
</Callout>

### Unified AI Gateway

A single API endpoint that connects to all major AI providers:

```typescript
// One simple API call
const response = await fetch('https://cencori.com/api/ai/chat', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'CENCORI_API_KEY': process.env.CENCORI_API_KEY,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: 'gpt-4o',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: userPrompt }]
  })
});
```

Switch between providers by simply changing the model parameter:

```typescript
// OpenAI GPT-4
{ model: 'gpt-4o' }

// Anthropic Claude
{ model: 'claude-3-opus' }

// Google Gemini
{ model: 'gemini-2.5-flash' }
```

No need to maintain separate SDKs, authentication logic, or error handling for each provider.

### Complete Observability

Every request flows through Cencori, giving you complete visibility into your AI operations:

- **Request Logs** - Full request and response data with metadata
- **Analytics Dashboard** - Usage trends, costs, and performance metrics
- **Security Incidents** - Real-time alerts when threats are detected
- **Cost Attribution** - Track spending by user, feature, or team

<Callout type="idea" title="debugging Made Easy">
When something goes wrong in production, having detailed logs of every AI interaction is invaluable. Cencori makes debugging AI applications as straightforward as debugging traditional APIs.
</Callout>
