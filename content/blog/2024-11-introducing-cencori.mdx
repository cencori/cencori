## Why We Built Cencori

One month ago, we dropped a simple demo showing how to create organizations and projects. Today, we're launching something much bigger: **a complete security layer for AI applications**.

### The Problem

As AI applications move from prototypes to production, developers face three critical challenges:

1. **Security Threats**: Prompt injections, PII leakage, jailbreaks
2. **Multi-Model Complexity**: Managing OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google APIs separately
3. **Compliance Requirements**: Audit logs, data retention, SOC 2

Building all of this from scratch takes months. We know - we've done it multiple times.

### The Solution

**Cencori** sits between your application and AI providers, giving you:

- ✅ **Prompt Injection Detection** - Block malicious inputs before they reach your models
- ✅ **Multi-Provider Gateway** - Switch between GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini seamlessly  
- ✅ **Audit Logs** - Track every request for compliance and debugging
- ✅ **Cost Optimization** - Monitor spend per user, feature, or model

## How It Works

```typescript
// Before: Direct OpenAI call
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: userInput }]
});

// After: Cencori gateway
const response = await fetch('https://cencori.com/api/ai/chat', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'CENCORI_API_KEY': 'cen_...',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: 'gpt-4',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: userInput }]
  })
});
```

That's it. One endpoint change, and you get enterprise-grade security + multi-provider support.

## What We've Shipped

In just 30 days, we built:

### AI Gateway
A unified routing layer that connects to OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. Switch models without changing code.

### Multi-Model Support  
Run the same prompt across GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini to compare outputs, latency, and cost.

### Security Layer
Real-time detection of:
- Prompt injections
- PII in requests/responses
- Unusual access patterns

### Analytics Dashboard
Track:
- Total requests and cost
- Success rate and latency
- Model usage breakdown
- Security incidents

## Who It's For

**AI Companies**: Secure your product without building infrastructure  
**Indie Hackers**: Enterprise features at indie-friendly pricing  
**Dev Teams**: Ship faster with built-in compliance

## Get Started

**Free tier**: 1,000 requests/month  
**Pro**: $49/month for 50,000 requests  
**Enterprise**: Custom limits and SLA

## What's Next

We're just getting started. Coming soon:

- Custom security rules (define your own policies)
- Streaming support for real-time responses  
- More providers (Cohere, AI21, Mistral)
- Self-hosted deployment option

Follow along as we build in public. Questions? Hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bolaabanjo) or email [support@cencori.com](mailto:support@cencori.com).

Let's make AI apps more secure, together.
