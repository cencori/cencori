We redesigned Cencori with a new design language we call **Cenpact** (Cencori + Compact).

## The Philosophy

| Principle | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Dense but Breathable** | Pack information tightly while maintaining visual hierarchy |
| **Subtle Sophistication** | Muted colors, soft borders, understated hover effects |
| **Developer-First** | Design for power users who value efficiency |
| **Dark Mode Native** | Built for dark mode first |

## What Changed

- **Dashboard:** Compact cards, smaller typography, tighter spacing
- **Blog:** Simplified cards, denser content, cleaner article pages
- **Docs:** Reduced padding, smaller headers, focused reading experience
- **Dynamic OG Images:** Auto-generated social preview cards with Cenpact styling

The result is a UI that shows more information with less scrolling, without feeling cramped.
