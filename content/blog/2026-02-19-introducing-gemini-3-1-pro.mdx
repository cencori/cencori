Google has just released **Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview**, and we're excited to announce that it's available today on Cencori.

As Google's newest flagship offering, Gemini 3.1 Pro represents a significant leap forward in reasoning capabilities and agentic engineering usability.

## What's New?

Gemini 3.1 Pro isn't just a minor iteration. It introduces several key enhancements that make it a powerhouse for complex AI applications:

### 1. Enhanced Reasoning
3.1 Pro scores higher on complex problem-solving benchmarks, providing more accurate and nuanced responses for intricate logic tasks.

### 2. Massive 1M Context Window
Process entire code repositories, massive PDF documents, or hour-long videos in a single request. With a **1 million token context window**, you can feed the model everything it needs to know without worrying about hitting limits.

### 3. Optimized for Agentic Workflows
The new `gemini-3.1-pro-preview-customtools` endpoint is specifically designed for developers building AI agents. It features improved performance when handling simultaneous, multi-step tool calls and bash operations.

## Use it Today

You can start using Gemini 3.1 Pro through the Cencori SDK immediately.

```typescript
import { Cencori } from '@cencori';

const cencori = new Cencori();

// Traditional chat
const response = await cencori.ai.chat({
  model: 'gemini-3.1-pro-preview',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Analyze this repo architecture...' }]
});

// Specialized tool use for agents
const agentResponse = await cencori.ai.chat({
  model: 'gemini-3.1-pro-preview-customtools',
  messages: [...]
});
```

We've updated our [Providers Documentation](/docs/ai/providers) with the latest model IDs and configuration details.

Stay tuned as we continue to roll out more frontier models as soon as they drop!
