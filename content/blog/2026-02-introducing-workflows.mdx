Today, we are launching **Cencori Workflows**, a complete toolchain for building autonomous AI agents.

For the past year, "Agents" have been a buzzword. Demos look great, but production is a nightmare of race conditions, infinite loops, and lost state.

We built Workflows to solve this. It is the **Serverless Operating System** for your AI agents.

## 1. Adaptive Memory: The "Living Profile"

The biggest problem with agents is context. RAG is too static; Chat History is too noisy.

**Adaptive Memory** changes the game. Instead of just searching documents, your agent **observes** user interactions in the background and updates a structured profile in real-time.

```typescript
// It just works in the background
cencori.on('chat.message', async (event) => {
  const profile = await cencori.memory.adaptive.update(event.userId, event.text);
  console.log('User Profile Updated:', profile);
});
```

## 2. The Visual Editor (Coming Soon)

We believe in **Code-First**, but not "Code-Only."
Our new Visual Editor bidirectionally syncs with your TypeScript code. PMs can prototype flows on the canvas, and engineers get clean, type-safe code to review.

## 3. Production-Grade Reliability

Cencori Workflows isn't just a library. It's a distributed system.
*   **Durable Execution**: If your step fails, we retry it with exponential backoff.
*   **State Persistence**: We save the state after every step.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop**: Pause a workflow for days to wait for approval.

## Comparisions

How do we fit in?
*   **vs LangChain**: We are the cloud backend. You don't manage servers.
*   **vs Vercel AI SDK**: We power the intelligence. Use Vercel for the UI.

## Try it Today

Workflows are available in Public Beta starting today.
`npm install cencori@latest`
