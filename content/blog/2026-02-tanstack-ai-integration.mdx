We're excited to announce that **Cencori is now an official adapter for TanStack AI**.

This means developers using TanStack AI can now access OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, and more—all through a single, unified integration with built-in security and observability.

## Why This Matters

[TanStack AI](https://tanstack.com/ai) is quickly becoming one of the go-to toolkits for building AI applications. It's framework-agnostic, lightweight, and designed for modern React and TypeScript workflows.

With Cencori as an adapter, you get:

- **Every major AI model** through one SDK
- **Automatic PII detection and content filtering**
- **Full request logging** with tokens, cost, and latency
- **Provider failover** when APIs go down

No need to manage multiple API keys or build your own safety layer—Cencori handles it.

## Getting Started

It's two packages:

```bash
npm install @cencori/ai-sdk @tanstack/ai
```

And a few lines of code:

```typescript
import { chat } from "@tanstack/ai";
import { cencori } from "@cencori/ai-sdk/tanstack";

for await (const chunk of chat({
  adapter: cencori("gpt-4o"),
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello!" }],
})) {
  process.stdout.write(chunk.delta);
}
```

Swap `gpt-4o` for `claude-3-5-sonnet` or `gemini-2.5-flash`—same code, different provider.

## What's Next

This is just the beginning. We're working on deeper integrations with more frameworks and platforms. If you're building with TanStack AI, we'd love to hear how it goes.
