OpenClaw users can now connect directly to Cencori using the normal OpenAI-compatible flow:

- `OPENAI_BASE_URL`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- optional `CENCORI_AGENT_ID`

No extra protocol, no custom gateway glue, no required `X-Agent-ID` header.

If your tool can target an OpenAI-compatible endpoint, it can use Cencori.

## Why This Matters

OpenClaw is a strong agent runtime for desktop automation. Cencori adds the production layer around it:

- centralized model routing
- configurable system prompts
- live monitoring
- safety approvals with Shadow Mode
- usage and cost tracking

So you keep OpenClaw’s autonomy and add control from one dashboard.

## Quick Start

### 1. Deploy OpenClaw from Agent Marketplace

In Cencori:
- go to `Agents -> Agent Marketplace`
- deploy the OpenClaw blueprint
- open the agent’s Configuration tab

### 2. Generate your Cencori API key

Create or roll a key in the same Configuration page.

### 3. Connect OpenClaw using environment variables

```bash
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://cencori.com/api/v1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=cake_your_key_here
# Optional: force a specific agent (multi-agent setups)
export CENCORI_AGENT_ID=your_agent_id
```

Then run OpenClaw:

```bash
openclaw onboard
```

### 4. Optional: use OpenClaw provider config file

If you prefer `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "models": {
    "providers": {
      "cencori": {
        "baseUrl": "https://cencori.com/api/v1",
        "apiKey": "cake_your_key_here",
        "api": "openai-completions"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## What Happens in Cencori

Once connected:

- all requests route through your Cencori gateway
- selected model in Agent Configuration is applied
- system prompt is injected from dashboard config
- actions appear in Live Feed
- Shadow Mode can require approval before risky tool execution

## Important Behavior

`CENCORI_AGENT_ID` is optional.

By default, Cencori resolves the agent from the API key.  
Set `CENCORI_AGENT_ID` only when you want explicit routing in multi-agent workflows.

## Recommended First Run

For safety, start with:
- `Shadow Mode` on
- a test API key
- a constrained prompt (limited directories/domains)

This gives you fast validation with guardrails before broader rollout.

## Start Here

- OpenClaw docs: `/docs/agents/openclaw`
- Agents overview: `/docs/agents/overview`

If you're already using OpenClaw, point it to Cencori and you’re live.
